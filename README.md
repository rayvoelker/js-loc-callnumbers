js-loc-callnumbers
==================

A javascript class to normalize and perform various sorting options on Library of Congress Call Numbers within a library institution.

My main intended use for this class is to provide sorting and comparison functions for library catalog searches in relationship to the pysical location of the material in the library stacks -- although, the other various functions may be useful in other projects.

This is adapted from the efforts of various other developers and projects; including, but not necessarily limited to the following :

Unfortunatly, the regular expression used in this project may have very distinct limitations in your particular institution; so please let me know if anyone out there has a more complete regular expression (or a more reliable way to parse and "normalize") that defines any and all perfectly valid Library of Congress Call Numbers.
